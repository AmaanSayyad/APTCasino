The inspiration behind APT-Casino comes from a deep dissatisfaction with traditional online gaming launchpads and gambling platforms. We envisioned a platform that addresses the unfair practices and limitations of conventional game publishing and gambling sites making it more interactive, rewarding, and accessible.

The lack of support from major game publishers like Steam, Nintendo, and Playstation for Web3 games motivated us to create a comprehensive platform that empowers game developers to bring their creations to life in a decentralized, community-driven ecosystem. By combining GameFi and DeFi, APT-Casino is set to revolutionize how people engage, launch and interact with games.

## Problems
The traditional online gaming launchpads and gambling sites have several loopholes:

- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** Many gambling platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.
- **High Fees:** Users often encounter high fees for deposits, withdrawals, and transactions.
- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Conventional gambling sites impose withdrawal limits and conditions that prevent users from accessing their funds.
- **Misleading Bonus Schemes:** Users are trapped by unrealistic wagering requirements tied to bonus schemes.
- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.
- **Limited Support for Web3 Games:** Major game publishers have yet to embrace Web3, leaving developers without the necessary tools to launch and manage blockchain-based games.
- **Lack of Community Engagement:** Gaming platforms often fail to foster vibrant, interactive communities where users can collaborate and grow together.
